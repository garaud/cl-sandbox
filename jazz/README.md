This is the stub README.txt for the "jazz" project.

Empty project to understand the ASDF system and package stuff.

Also to see how I can write unit test in a dedicated Lisp file.

* Install quicklisp
* Link this project to `~/quicklisp/local-projects`
* `(ql:quickload 'jazz)`
* `(load "./test.lisp")` to launch the tests
* It's better to launch the tests from SLIME, but it's also possible to do `sbcl
  --load test.lisp`.
