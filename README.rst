######################

Some Common Lisp files to try, understand and improve my knowledge.

Folders:

* AI-programming

  Tests, examples or exercices inspired from *Artificial Intelligence
  Programming* by Peter Norvig

* Simple Database

  My version of the *Music Database* from the excellent chapter 3 "`Practical: A
  Simple Database
  <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/practical-a-simple-database.html>`_" in
  `Practical Common Lisp <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/>`_

* Spam Filter

  A version of the *Practical Spam Filter* chapter 23 of `Practical Common Lisp
  <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/>`_

* Jazz

  A simple and stupid Lisp package. I wanted to understand the ASDF system and
  Lisp packages mechanisms

* 99-problems

  A version of the `99 Lisp Problems <http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html>`_
