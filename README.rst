My Common Lisp Sandbox
######################

Some Common Lisp files to try, understand and improve my knowledge.

Folders:

* AI-programming

  Tests, examples or exercices inspired from *Artificial Intelligence
  Programming* by Peter Norvig

* Simple Database

  My version of the *Music Database* from the excellent chapter 3 "`Practical: A
  Simple Database

  `Practical Common Lisp <http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/>`_
